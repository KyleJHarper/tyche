Tyche - Example Project for the Harper Cache Replacement Strategy (HCRS)
=====

The tyche project (prefer to keep it lower case) is actually just an implementation of the currently-theoretical Harper Cache Replacement Strategy (still in private development).

This will be open source (as will the HCRS theory) but I am still going to enforce the Apache 2.0 software license to it.
